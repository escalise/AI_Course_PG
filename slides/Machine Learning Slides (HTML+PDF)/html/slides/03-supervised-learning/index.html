Hey everybody.
Today, we’ll be talking more in-depth about supervised learning,
model evaluation and model selection.

FIXME:
More details on implementing cross-validation?
Grouped cross-validation?
FIXME cross_validation function?
FIXME kick out nearest centroids?
FIXME in nearest centroid shrinkage plot, label axes, put in diagonal as identity, put in points as examples
FIXME overfitting the validation set?
FIXME we have the threefold split before it's introduced?
FIXME make plot to illustrate overfitting test set? allude to kaggle?
FIXME should we do empirical risk minimization in this lecture at underfitting vs overfitting?

$$ (x_i, y_i) \propto p(x, y) \text{ i.i.d.}$$
$$ x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$$
$$ y_i \in \mathbb{R}$$
$$f(x_i) \approx y_i$$
$$f(x) \approx y$$
]
???
As a reminder, in supervised learning, the dataset we learn form is
input-output pairs $(x_i, y_i)$, where $x_i$ is some n-dimensional input,
or feature vector, and $y_i$ is the desired output we want to learn to predict.
We assume these samples are drawn from some unknown joint distribution
$p(x, y)$.
You can think of this as there being some (not necessarily deterministic)
process that goes from $x_i$ to $y_i$, but that we don’t know.
We try to find a function that approximates the output $y_i$ for each known
input $x_i$. But we also demand that for new inputs $x$ , and unobserved $y$,
$f(x)$ is approximately $y$.

I want to go through two simple examples of supervised algorithms today,
nearest neighbors and nearest centroids.

# Nearest Neighbors

![:scale 40%](images/knn_boundary_test_points.png)
$$f(x) = y_i, i = \text{argmin}_j || x_j - x||$$

???
Let’s say we have this two-class classification dataset here, with
two features, one on the x axis and one on the y axis.
And we have three new points as marked by the stars here.
If I make a prediction using a one nearest neighbor classifier, what
will it predict?
It will predict the label of the closest data point in the training set.
That is basically the simplest machine learning algorithm I can come
up with.

Here’s the formula:
the prediction for a new x is the y_i so that x_i is the closest point
in the training set.
Ok, so now how do we find out whether this model is any good?

The simplest way is to split the data into a training and a test set.
So we take some part of the data set,  let’s say 75% and the
corresponding output, and train the model, and then apply the model on
the remaining 25% to compute the accuracy. This test-set accuracy
will provide an unbiased estimate of future performance.
So if our i.i.d. assumption is correct, and we get a 90% success
rate on the test data, we expect about a 90% success rate on any future
data, for which we don't have labels.

Let's dive into how to build and evaluate this model with scikit-learn.
---
# KNN with scikit-learn

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=1)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("accuracy: {:.2f}".format(knn.score(X_test, y_test)))
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)
```
accuracy: 0.77

???
We import train_test_split form model selection, which does a
random split into 75%/25%.
We provide it with the data X, which are our two features, and the
labels y.

As you might already know, all the models in scikit-learn are implemented
in python classes, with a single object used to build and store the model.

We start by importing our model, the KneighborsClassifier, and instantiate
it with n_neighbors=1. Instantiating the object is when we set any hyper parameter,
such as here saying that we only want to look at the neirest neighbor.

Then we can call the fit method to build the model, here knn.fit(X_train,
y_train)
All models in scikit-learn have a fit-method, and all the supervised ones take
the data X and the outcomes y. The fit method builds the model and stores any
estimated quantities in the model object, here knn.  In the case of nearest
neighbors, the `fit` methods simply remembers the whole training set.

Then, we can use knn.score to make predictions on the test data, and
compare them against the true labels y_test.

For classification models, the score method will always compute
accuracy. 

Just for illustration purposes, I also call the predict method here.
The predict method is what's used to make predictions on any dataset.
If we use the score method, it calls predict internally and then
compares the outcome to the ground truth that's provided.

Who here has not seen this before?

# Influence of Number of Neighbors

![:scale 50%](images/knn_boundary_k1.png)

???
So this was the predictions as made by one-nearest neighbor.
But we can also consider more neighbors, for example three. Here is the
three nearest neighbors for each of the points and the corresponding
labels.
We can then make a prediction by considering the majority among these
three neighbors.
And as you can see, in this case all the points changed their labels! (I
was actually quite surprised when I saw that, I just picked some points
at random).
Clearly the number of neighbors that we consider matters a lot. But what
is the right number?
The is a problem you’ll encounter a lot in machine learning, the
problem of tuning parameters of the model, also called hyper-parameters,
which can not be learned directly from the data.

# Influence of n_neighbors

![:scale 45%](images/knn_boundary_varying_k.png)

???
Here’s an overview of how the classification changes if we consider
different numbers of neighbors.
You can see as red and blue circles the training data. And the background
is colored according to which class a datapoint would be assigned to
for each location.
For one neighbor, you can see that each point in the training set has
a little area around it that would be classified according to it’s
label. This means all the training points would be classified correctly,
but it leads to a very complex shape of the decision boundary.
If we increase the number of neighbors, the boundary between red and
blue simplifies, and with 40 neighbors we mostly end up with a line.
This also means that now many of the training data points would be
labeled incorrectly.

# Model complexity

![:scale 75%](images/knn_model_complexity.png)

???
We can look at this in more detail by comparing training and test set
scores for the different numbers of neighbors.
Here, I did a random 75%/25% split again. This is a very noisy plot as
the dataset is very small and I only did a random split, but you can
see a trend here.
You can see that for a single neighbor, the training score is 1 so perfect
accuracy, but the test score is only 70%.  If we increase the number of
neighbors we consider, the training score goes down, but the test score
goes up, with an optimum at 19 and 21, but then both go down again.

This is a very typical behavior, that I sketched in a schematic for you.

# Overfitting and Underfitting

![:scale 80%](images/overfitting_underfitting_cartoon_full.png)

???
If we use too simple a model, this is often called underfitting, while
if we use to complex a model, this is called overfitting. And somewhere
in the middle is a sweet spot.
Most models have some way to tune model complexity, and we’ll see many
of them in the next couple of weeks.
So going back to nearest neighbors, what parameters correspond to high
model complexity and what to low model complexity? high n_neighbors =
low complexity!

class: center
# Nearest Centroid

![:scale 35%](images/nearest_centroid_boundary.png)

$$f(x) = \text{argmin}_{i \in Y} ||\bar{x}_i - x||$$

???
Before we go to more techniques to find the right hyper parameters,
I want to introduce another simple model, nearest centroid.
The nearest centroid model simply computes the centroid, or the mean of
each class, and classifies each point by which centroid is the closest.
You can write that down as a formula such as here, where x_i bar is the
centroid, and I runs over the classes.
You can see that this yields a linear decision boundary between the
two classes.
---
# Nearest Centroid with scikit-learn

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

from sklearn.neighbors import NearestCentroid
nc = NearestCentroid()
nc.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("accuracy: {:.2f}".format(nc.score(X_test, y_test)))
```

```
accuracy: 0.62
```

???
Again, we can easily build this model with scikit-learn and evaluate it
using a test set.
We use the train_test_split function to split the data into 75% training
and 25% test data,
import the nearest centroid model, fit it on the training set, and
compute the accuracy on the test set.
In this case, the fit method computes the mean or centroid of each class
and stores it in the nc object, while for prediction 

Questions so far?

class: center, middle

![:scale 80%](images/knn_vs_nearest_centroid.png)
???
Here is a very simple example where a nearest neighbor algorithm might
work, while nearest centroid fails because it is limited to linear
decision boundaries.
We’ll talk more about linear decision boundaries and their strength
and weaknesses on Wednesday.

Now, I want to talk more about how to adjust the parameters in these
models - or really, in any model.

![:scale 80%](images/train_test_set_2d_classification.png)

???
So far we’ve work with a split of the data into a training and a test
set, build the model on the training set, and evaluated on the test set.
So now, lets say we want to adjust the parameter n_neigbhbors in k
neighbors algorithm, how could we do this?
[split, try out different values of k, choose the best on test set]
What’s the problem with that?
- good for choosing k, overly optimistic for getting accuracy!

# Threefold split
.padding-top[
![:scale 100%](images/threefold_split.png)
]
???
The simplest way to combat this overfitting to the test set is by using
a three-fold split of the data, into a training, a validation and a
test set as we just did.
We use the training set for model building, the validation set for
parameter selection and the test set for a final evaluation of the model.
So how many models should you try out on the test set? Only one! Ideally
use use the test-set exactly once, otherwise you make a multiple
hypothesis testing error!

What are downsides of this? We lose a lot of data for evaluation, and
the results depend on the particular sampling.

# Threefold Split for Hyper-Parameters

.smaller[
```python
X_trainval, X_test, y_trainval, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_trainval, y_trainval)

val_scores = []
neighbors = np.arange(1, 15, 2)
for i in neighbors:
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=i)
    knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
    val_scores.append(knn.score(X_val, y_val))
print("best validation score: {:.3f}".format(np.max(val_scores)))
best_n_neighbors = neighbors[np.argmax(val_scores)]
print("best n_neighbors:", best_n_neighbors)

knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=best_n_neighbors)
knn.fit(X_trainval, y_trainval)
print("test-set score: {:.3f}".format(knn.score(X_test, y_test)))
```

```
best validation score: 0.991
best n_neighbors: 11
test-set score: 0.951
```
]
???
Here is an implementation of the three-fold split for selecting the
number of neighbors.
For each number of neighbors that we want to try, we build a model on
the training set, and evaluate it on the validation set.
We then pick the best validation set score, here that’s 97.2%, achieved
when using three neighbors.
We then retrain the model with this parameter, and evaluate on the test set.
The retraining step is somewhat optional. We could also just use the best
model. But retraining allows us to make better use of all the data.

Still, depending on the test-set size we might be using only 70% or 80%
of the data, and our results depend on how exactly we split the datasets.
So how can we make this more robust?
---
# Cross-validation
.padding-top[
![:scale 100%](images/kfold_cv.png)]
???
The answer is of course cross-validation. In cross-validation, you split
your data into multiple folds, usually 5 or 10, and built multiple models.
You start by using fold1 as the test data, and the remaining ones as the
training data. You build your model on the training data, and evaluate
it on the test fold.
For each of the splits of the data, you get a model evaluation and a
score. In the end, you can aggregate the scores, for example by taking
the mean.
What are the pros and cons of this?
Each data point is in the test-set exactly once!
Takes 5 or 10 times longer!
Better data use (larger training sets).
Does that solve all problems? No, it replaces only one of the splits,
usually the inner one!

# Cross-validation + test set

![:scale 70%](images/grid_search_cross_validation.png)

???
Here is how the workflow looks like when we are using five-fold
cross-validation together with a test-set split for adjusting parameters.
We start out by splitting of the test data, and then we perform
cross-validation on the training set.
Once we found the right setting of the parameters, we retrain on the
whole training set and evaluate on the test set.

# Grid-Search with Cross-Validation

.smaller[
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
cross_val_scores = []

for i in neighbors:
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=i)
    scores = cross_val_score(knn, X_train, y_train, cv=10)
    cross_val_scores.append(np.mean(scores))
    
print("best cross-validation score: {:.3f}".format(np.max(cross_val_scores)))
best_n_neighbors = neighbors[np.argmax(cross_val_scores)]
print("best n_neighbors:", best_n_neighbors)

knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=best_n_neighbors)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("test-set score: {:.3f}".format(knn.score(X_test, y_test)))
```

```
best cross-validation score: 0.967
best n_neighbors: 9
test-set score: 0.965
```
]

???
Here is an implementation of this  for k nearest neighbors.

We split the data, then we iterate over all parameters and for each of
them we do cross-validation.

We had seven different values of n_neighbors, and we are running 10 fold
cross-validation. How many models to we train in total?
10 * 7 + 1 = 71 (the one is the final model)
---
class: center, middle
![:scale 80%](images/gridsearch_workflow.png)

???
Here is a conceptual overview of this way of tuning parameters, we start
of with the dataset and a candidate set of parameters we want to try,
labeled parameter grid, for example the number of neighbors.

We split the dataset in to training and test set. We use cross-validation
and the parameter grid to find the best parameters.
We use the best parameters and the training set to build a model with
the best parameters,
and finally evaluate it on the test set.


Because this is such a common pattern, there is a helper class for this
in scikit-learn, called GridSearch CV, which does most of these steps
for you.
---
# GridSearchCV
.smaller[
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y)


param_grid = {'n_neighbors':  np.arange(1, 15, 2)}

grid = GridSearchCV(KNeighborsClassifier(), param_grid=param_grid,
                    cv=10, return_train_score=True)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("best mean cross-validation score: {:.3f}".format(grid.best_score_))
print("best parameters: {}".format(grid.best_params_))

print("test-set score: {:.3f}".format(grid.score(X_test, y_test)))
```

```
best mean cross-validation score: 0.967
best parameters: {'n_neighbors': 9}
test-set score: 0.993
```
]
???
Here is an example.
We still need to split our data into training and test set.
We declare the parameters we want to search over as a dictionary. In
this example the parameter is just n_neighbors and the values we want
to try out are a range. The keys of the dictionary are the parameter
names and the values are the parameter settings we want to try. If you
specify multiple parameters, all possible combinations are tried. This
is where the name grid-search comes from - it’s an exhaustive search
over all possible parameter combinations that you specify.

GridSearchCV is a class, and it behaves just like any other model in
scikit-learn, with a fit, predict and score method.
It’s what we call a meta-estimator, since you give it one estimator,
here the KneighborsClassifier, and from that GridSearchCV constructs a
new estimator that does the parameter search for you.
You also specify the parameters you want to search, and the
cross-validation strategy.
Then GridSearchCV does all the other things we talked about, it does the
cross-validation and parameter selection, and retrains a model with the
best parameter settings that were found.
We can check out the best cross-validation score and the best parameter
setting with the best_score_ and best_params_ attributes.
And finally we can compute the accuracy on the test set, simply but
using the score method! That will use the retrained model under the hood.

# Cross-Validation Strategies

???
So I mentioned k-fold cross validation, where k is usually 5 or ten,
but there are many other strategies.

One of the most commonly ones is stratified k-fold cross-validation.
---
# StratifiedKFold

![:scale 100%](images/stratified_cv.png)

Stratified:
Ensure relative class frequencies in each fold reflect relative class
frequencies on the whole dataset.

???
The idea behind stratified k-fold cross-validation is that you want the
test set to be as representative of the dataset as possible.
StratifiedKFold preserves the class frequencies in each fold to be the
same as of the overall dataset.
Here is and example of a dataset with three classes that are ordered. If
you apply standard three-fold to this, the first third of the data would
be in the first fold, the second in the second fold and the third in
the third fold. Because this data is sorted, that would be particularly
bad. If you use stratified cross-validation it would make sure that each
fold has exactly 1/3 of the data from each class.

This is also helpful if your data is very imbalanced. If some of the
classes are very rare, it could otherwise happen that a class is not
present at all in a particular fold.
---
# Defaults in scikit-learn

- 3-fold is the deprecated default, 5-fold in 0.22
- For classification cross-validation is stratified
- train_test_split has stratify option:
train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y)

- No shuffle by default!

???
Before we go to the other strategies, I wanted to point out the default
behavior in scikit-learn.
By default, all cross-validation strategies are three-fold.
If you do cross-validation for classification, it will be stratified
by default.
Because of how the interface is done, that’s not true for
train_test_split and if you want a stratified train_test_split, which
is always a good idea, you should use stratify=y
Another thing that’s important to keep in mind is that by default
scikit-learn doesn’t shuffle! So if you run cross-validation twice
with the default parameters, it will yield exactly the same results.
