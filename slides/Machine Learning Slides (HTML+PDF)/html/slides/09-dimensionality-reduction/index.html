Today we're going to talk about dimensionality reduction,
mostly about principal component analysis. We're also going
to talk about discriminant analysis and manifold learning.

These all slightly different sets of goals. But the main
idea here is to take a high dimensional input dataset and
produce the dimensionality for processing. It can be either
before the machine learning pipeline or often for
visualization.

# Unsupervized Learning

- Unsupervised learning subsumes all kinds of machine learning where there is no known output, no teacher to instruct the learning algorithm.

- Unsupervised learning involves tasks that operate on datasets without labeled responses or target values

- The learning algorithm is just shown the input data and asked to extract knowledge from this data.

- We will look into two kinds of unsupervised learning in this course: __transformations of the dataset__ (i.e. dimensionality reduction) and __clustering__.

???
---
# Applications of Unsupervized Learning

- Visualize structure of a complex dataset.

- Density estimation to predict probabilities of events. 

- Compress and summarize the data.

- Extract features for supervised learning.

- Discover important clusters or outliers.
???

# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- PCA finds the directions of the maximum variant in the data.

- PCA returns an orthogonal basis of the space where the components are ordered by how much variance of the data they cover and so we get a new basis of the original space.

- This new basis corresponds to rotating the input space (in the example the first component is my X-axis and the second component is my Y-axis and this is the transformation that PCA learns).

- We can use PCA for dimensionality reduction dropping some of the dimensions (they are ordered by decreasing variance).

- The idea is that does a PCA projection covers as much as possible of the data set.

- You can also look at PCA as a de-noising algorithm.

Here, we have a 2D input space, there's some point scattered
here. The color is supposed to show you where the data goes
in the transformations. PCA finds the directions of the
maximum variant in the data.

So starting with this blob of data, you look at the
direction that is the most elongated. And then you look for
the next opponent that captures the second most various,
that's orthogonal to the first component. Here in
2-dimensions, there's only one possibility to be orthogonal
to the first component and so that's our second component.

If you're in higher dimensions, there are obviously
infinitely many different directions that could be
orthogonal, and so then you would iterate.

What PCA returns is basically an orthogonal basis of the
space where the components are ordered by how much variance
of the data they cover and so we get a new basis of the
original space. So we can do this until like N dimensions
many times. In this example, I could do two times, after
that there are no orthogonal vectors left.

And so this new basis corresponds to rotating the input
space, I can rotate the input space so that the first
component is my X-axis and the second component is my Y-axis
and this is the transformation that PCA learns.

This doesn't do any dimensionality reduction as of yet, this
is just a rotation of the input space. If I want to use it
for dimensionality reduction, I can now start dropping some
of these dimensions. So they are ordered by decreasing
variance, I could in this example drop, for example, the
second component only to regain the first component.

So basically, I dropped the Y-axis and projected everything
to the X line. And this would be dimensionality reduction
with the PCA going from two dimensions to one dimension. And
the idea is that if your data lives on a lower dimensional
space, or essentially lives on lower dimensional space,
embedded in high dimensional space, you could think of this
is mostly aligned or Gaussian blob along this direction and
there's a little bit of noise in this direction. The most
information about the data is sort of along this line.

The idea is that does one-dimensional projection now covers
as much as possible of this data set.

You can also look at PCA as being sort of a de-noising
algorithm, by taking this reduced representation in the
rotated space and rotating it back to the original space. So
this is basically transforming the data using PCA, the
rotation dropping one dimension rotating back, you end up
with this. And so this is through information that is
retained in this projection, basically. And so, arguably,
you still have a lot of information from this dataset.

# PCA Computation
- Center X (subtract mean).
- In practice: Also scale.
- Compute singular value decomposition (SVD):
![:scale 100%](images/pca-computation.png)
???
If I want to apply PCA to my dataset, the first thing I have
to do, which is sort of part of the algorithm subtracts the
mean. Any package will subtract the mean for you before it
does the SVD. What you should probably also do in practice
is to scale the data to unit variance.

And then the PCA algorithm just computes the singular level
decomposition.

We decompose the data X into an orthogonal, a diagonal, and
an orthogonal. V^T is number of features, U is number of
samples times number of samples, D is diagonal containing
singular values. Singular values correspond to the variance
of each of these directions. Usually, in SVD you sort them
by singular values. So the largest singular value
corresponds to the first principle components.

There's an additional processing step that you can do which
is the most basic form of PCA. You can also use these
entries of the diagonal to really scale the data in the
rotated space so that the variance is the same across each
of the new dimensions.

# PCA for Visualization

I want to show you an example on real data set. So the first
data set I'm going to use it on is the breast cancer data
set.

The way I use PCA most often is probably for visualization.
I often do PCA with two components, because my monitor has
two dimensions.

I fit, transform the data and I scatter it and then I get
the scatter plot of the first principle component versus
second principal component. So this is the binary
classification problem, PCA obviously is a completely
unsupervised method, so it doesn't know what the class
labels but I could look whether this is a hard problem to
solve or is it an easy problem to solve. If I look at this
plot, maybe it looks like it's a relatively easy problem to
solve with the points being relatively well separated.

Now I look at the principal component vectors. So there are
two principal components, each of them has number of
features many dimensions. So this is shown here as a heat
map. And you can see that there are basically two features
that dominate the principal components, which is mean area
and worst area. And all the rest of the entries are
approximately zero. So actually, I didn't rotate my data at
all, I just looked at two features.

So I didn't scale my data, if I don't scale my data and a
particular feature has a much larger magnitude, this feature
will basically be the first principle component because if I
multiply a feature by 10,000, this feature will have the
largest variance of everything. There will be no direction
that has a larger variance than that.

# Scaling!
.tiny-code[```python
pca_scaled = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), PCA(n_components=2))
X_pca_scaled = pca_scaled.fit_transform(cancer.data)
plt.scatter(X_pca_scaled[:, 0], X_pca_scaled[:, 1], c=cancer.target, alpha=.9)
plt.xlabel("first principal component")
plt.ylabel("second principal component")
```]
.center[![:scale 45%](images/scaled-pca-for-visualization-cancer-data.png)]
???
So now I scale the data. And then I get two components on
the cancer data set. And now actually the data looks even
better separated. Even with this unsupervised methods it
very clearly shows me what separation of the classes is, I
can also see things like the yellow class looks much denser
than the purple class, maybe there are some outliers here,
but this definitely gives me a good idea of this dataset.

So this is much more compact than looking at a 30x30 scatter
matrix, which I couldn't comprehend. So we can look at the
components again.



Imagine one feature with very large scale. Without scaling,
itâs guaranteed to be the first principal component!

# Inspecting components
.tiny-code[```python
components = pca_scaled.named_steps['pca'].components_
plt.imshow(components.T)
plt.yticks(range(len(cancer.feature_names)), cancer.feature_names)
plt.colorbar()
```]
.smaller.left-column[
![:scale 70%](images/inspecting-pca-scaled-components.png)
]

.right-column[
![:scale 100%](images/inspecting-pca-scaled-components-2.png)]

???
So components are stored in the components attribute of the
PCA class. And you can see now all of the features
contribute to the principal components.

And if you're an expert in the area, and you know what these
features mean, sometimes it's possible to read something in
this. It's definitely helpful often to look at these
component vectors.

Another way to visualize the component vectors is to do a
scatter plot. But that only works basically for the first
two principal components. So you can basically look at the
positions of the original features, each dot here is one of
the original features, and you can look at how much does
this feature contribute to principal component one versus
principal component two. And so I can see that the second
principal component is dominated by mean fractal dimension
and the first personal component is dominated by the worst
perimeter. And worse perimeter negatively contributes to the
second principal component. And worst case point is also
very strong in the first principle component but has zero in
the second principal component.

This was sort of the first approach trying to use PCA for
2-dimensional visualization and trying to understand what
the components mean.

sign of component is meaningless!

# PCA for regularization
.tiny-code[
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(cancer.data, cancer.target, stratify=cancer.target, random_state=0)
lr = LogisticRegression(C=10000).fit(X_train, y_train)
print(lr.score(X_train, y_train))
print(lr.score(X_test, y_test))
```
```
0.993
0.944
```
```python
pca_lr = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), PCA(n_components=2), LogisticRegression(C=10000))
pca_lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(pca_lr.score(X_train, y_train))
print(pca_lr.score(X_test, y_test))
```
```
0.961
0.923
```
]
???
One thing that PCA is often used for, in particular for
statistics oriented people, is using it for regularizing a
model. You can use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of your
data set and then you can do a model on the on the reduced
dimensional data set. Since it has fewer features, this will
have less complexity, less power so you can avoid
overfitting by reducing the dimensionality.

Iâve given an example here on the same data set. I'm using
logistic regression, and I basically turn off
regularization. Instead of using L2 regularization in linear
regression, I'm trying to do reduce the input space.

So you can see that, if I do that, I basically overfit the
data perfectly. So on the training dataset, I have 99.3%
accuracy, and on test dataset I have 44.4% accuracy.

Now if I use PCA with two dimensions, I reduce this down to
just two features. I basically reduce overfitting a lot so I
get a lower training score but I also get a lower test
score.

Generally, if you find that you only need 2-dimension to
solve a problem, then thatâs a very simple problem. But if
you're shooting for accuracy, clearly youâve regularized too
much, you're restricted to the model too much by just using
two components. One way to figure out a good number of
components, obviously, doing grid search with
cross-validation. Another way is to look at the variance
that it is covered by each of the components, so this is
basically the singular values.

# Summary
- PCA good for visualization, exploring correlations
- PCA can sometimes help with classification as regularization or for feature extraction.
- Check LDA and t-SNE: a supervised alternative to PCA.
???
PCA, I really like for visualization and for exploring
correlations, you can use it together with a classification
for regularization if you have lots of features. Often, I
find that regularization of the classifier works better.

T-SNE probably makes the nicest pictures of the bunch.

And if you want a linear transformation of your data in a
supervised setting Linear Discriminant Analysis is a good
alternative to PCA.

LDA also  also yields a rotation of the input spacA
